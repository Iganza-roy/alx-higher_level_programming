# Python - Exceptions
In Python, an **exception** is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. When an error occurs *during runtime*, Python raises an exception to handle the situation. Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero.
