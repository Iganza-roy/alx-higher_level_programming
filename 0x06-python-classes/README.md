# Python - Classes and Objects
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.
**Object-Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Key concepts in OOP include *classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.* It aims to model real-world entities and their interactions, promoting code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.
