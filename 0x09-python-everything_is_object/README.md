# Everything is object
An object is a fundamental concept representing a data structure that encapsulates data and the functions that operate on that data. Everything in Python is an object, including numbers, strings, functions, modules, and more.

### Key characteristics of objects in Python include:

- **Identity**: Every object has a unique identity, which distinguishes it from other objects. The ```id()``` function can be used to obtain the identity of an object.

- **Type**: Every object has a type that defines its behavior and the kind of values it can hold. The ```type()``` function can be used to obtain the type of an object.

- **Value**: An object has a value, which is the data it holds. For example, a string object holds a sequence of characters, and an integer object holds a numerical value.

- **Attributes and Methods**: Objects can have attributes (data associated with the object) and methods (functions associated with the object). You can access attributes and call methods using the dot notation (```object.attribute``` or ```object.method()```).

- **Mutability**: Some objects are mutable, meaning their value can be changed after creation (e.g., lists), while others are immutable, and their value cannot be changed (e.g., strings, tuples).
