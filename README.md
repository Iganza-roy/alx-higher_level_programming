# alx-higher_level_programming

Higher-level programming refers to the use of programming languages and tools that are designed to be more **abstract and user-friendly**. These languages provide a higher level of abstraction, allowing developers to write code that is closer to human language and concepts, rather than dealing with the low-level details of the computer's architecture.
