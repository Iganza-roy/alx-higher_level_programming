## The __init__ method:
The ```__init__``` method is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated (i.e. created). The method is useful to do any initialization (i.e. passing initial values to your object) you want to do with your object.
## The __str__ and __repr__ methods:
```__repr__``` is a special method in Python that is used to provide a string representation of an object. The name "repr" stands for "representation," and this method is meant to return a string that, when passed to the ```eval()``` function, should create an object with the same value.
```__str__``` is a special method in Python that is used to define the "informal" or "user-friendly" string representation of an object. It is called when the ```str()``` function is used on an object or when the ```print()``` function is called with an object.
## The __doc__ method:
```__doc__``` is another special attribute in Python that is used to access the docstring of a module, class, function, or method. 
## The __del__ method:
```__del__``` is a special method in Python that is used for garbage collection or finalization of an object. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed or deleted, typically before the memory occupied by the object is reclaimed.
