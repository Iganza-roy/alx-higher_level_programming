# JavaScript - Web jQuery

This repo contains my tasks on the Jquery project

jQuery simplifies front-end programming by providing an easy-to-use API for tasks such as DOM manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax. It offers cross-browser compatibility, reducing the need to write different code for different browsers.
